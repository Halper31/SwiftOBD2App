# SmartOBD2
Swiftui App that connects to ELM OBD2 scanners and reads available pids, this is a work is progress as I am learning as I go and will be making changes.

I am currently using the carly obd2 scanner, so the service and the characteristic uuids might be different from other devices

inspirations from https://github.com/HellaVentures/iOS-OBD-Example-App/ got a lot of help here on how to initialize and properly send commands
